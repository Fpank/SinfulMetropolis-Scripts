# Sinful Metropolis ðŸŽ®

A game project I developed while studying at IEK AKMI.

[SINFUL METROPOLIS DEMO](https://youtu.be/-wkdcIPLAFM)

Sinful Metropolis, as the name suggests, takes place in a dystopic modern society full of sins, in which our main character has to avoid them in order to be redeemed and free.
Only for him to find out that he cannot escape his fate and all that awaits is more despair. The game gets progressively harder as the falling objects, "sins," accelerate as time passes by.
Each falling object represents a sin. The apple represents lust, the fireball stands for wrath, the junk food depicts gluttony, and the sofa is associated with sloth.
